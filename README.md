# 🧠 Google Employee Attrition Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes employee attrition using a machine learning approach. I completed it to identify patterns and key drivers that lead to employee turnover, helping companies like Google make data-driven HR decisions.

## 📁 File

- `project_9_google_employee_attrition_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all steps from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore and visualize employee attrition data
- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Build classification models to predict attrition
- Evaluate model accuracy using key metrics
- Identify the most important features influencing attrition

---

## 🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – For machine learning models and evaluation

## 🔍 Workflow Overview

### 1. 📥 Data Import and Exploration
- Loaded the HR dataset (e.g., from CSV)
- Summarized numerical and categorical features
- Checked for missing values and outliers

### 2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using OneHot or Label Encoding
- Normalized/scaled features when required
- Split the dataset into training and test sets

### 3. 🤖 Model Building
- Trained classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree / Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy

### 4. 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve / AUC

### 5. 🔍 Feature Importance
- Identified and visualized the top predictors for attrition
